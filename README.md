# CS300 - Lab 4
## Erika Goetz, Aedan Pettit

We created a fractal terrain as directed by the project instructions.
This terrain is able to be rotated by left-clicking the mouse and dragging it across the screen.
Additionally, the user may reset the orientation of the terrain using the menu accessed via a right-click.
